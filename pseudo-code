Core feature would be game loop

feature: 1. click start, then start the game

2. there are some random targets on the wall , you need to shoot ball to hit them
(targets' coordinates are random)

3. ball will bounce infinitely,

4. ball's flying speed is normal at the beginning,  ball moving speed is faster when you go to next level

5. earn points whenever you hits targets

6. target on the wall disappears after it gets hit

7. you can get hit by the ball and lose life

8. the points you earn can help you trigger special events which require the consumption of points, such as all balls disappear or slower ball speed or others

=======================================================

1. randomly generated enemy, moving towards you

2. you get hit when they touch you

3. you need to shoot them with weapon

4 whenever you eliminate one, you earn points which are used to upgrade your shooting speed

5. whenever you kill all of them, you get to next level and encounter more enemies,  but level might just increase their movement speed instead of their amounts

6. you move faster than the enemy, and you have upgrade option when you have enough points,  e.g. you can upgrade your speed by pressing s,
or you can upgrade your attack speed by pressing a...  only 2 options.


when enemy gets hit, they slow down for 1s ~ 2s.

if ( !death ) {
  gameOn
  if(counterWin)
} else {
  lose, gameOver
}



I need to figure out how to generate different random position for enemy
